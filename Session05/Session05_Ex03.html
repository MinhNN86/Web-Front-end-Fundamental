      Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American
      singer-songwriter. Known for her autobiographical songwriting, artistic
      reinventions, and cultural impact, Swift is a leading figure in popular
      music and the subject of widespread media coverage, with a vast fanbase
      known as Swifties. <br />
      Swift signed to Big Machine Records in 2005, debuting as a country singer
      with the albums Taylor Swift (2006) and Fearless (2008). The singles
      "Teardrops on My Guitar", "Love Story", and "You Belong with Me" found
      crossover success on country and pop radio formats. She incorporated rock
      on Speak Now (2010) and electronics on Red (2012), later re-calibrating
      her image from country to pop with the synth-pop set 1989 (2014); the
      ensuing media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-imbued Reputation (2017). The
      albums contained the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles "We Are Never
      Ever Getting Back Together"; "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", "Bad Blood"
      and "Look What You Made Me Do".
